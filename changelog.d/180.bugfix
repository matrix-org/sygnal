Fix vapid_claims from one webpush request bleeding into others

The vapid_claims dict was reused across requests, but pywebpush actually modified this dictionary.
This made the pushkin usable with only a single pusher for a single user, any other pushers
would be rejected by their gateway as the aud claim (derived from the endpoint url)
didn't match the server name, and the pushkey would be rejected, removing the pusher.
