Fix vapid_claims from one webpush request bleeding into others

The vapid_claims dict was reused across requests, but pywebpush actually modifies this dictionary.
This made the pushkin usable with only a single pusher for a single user, any other pushers
would be rejected by their gateway, at least if from a different provider, as the aud claim
(the origin of the endpoint url) didn't match the server name, but would likely even fail for 
a single provider as the expiry time wasn't refreshed.
The resut was the pushkey would be rejected, removing the pusher.
