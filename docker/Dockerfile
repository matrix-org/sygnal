# build things which have slow build steps, before we copy sygnal, so that
# the layer can be cached.

# (we really just care about caching a wheel here, as the "pip install" below
# will install them again.)

# we need dependencies for postgresql
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc git libpq-dev
